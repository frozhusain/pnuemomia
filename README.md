# Pnuemomia detection using deep learning CNN

This is a basic project in which we developed an algorithm to automatically identify whether a patient is suffering from pneumonia or not by looking at chest X-ray images. The algorithm had to be extremely accurate because lives of people is at stake.The model is trained on pre-trained VGG16 network with imagnet weights.

## Prerequisites

scikit-learn
keras
numpy
pandas
matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia data set link

The data comes in three folders, one for the training set and one for the test set and one for the validation set. The training set folder contains a folder of images for pneumonia cases and a folder of images for normal cases. The training set consists of 5216 images total. The test set folder contains a folder of images for pneumonia cases and a folder of images for normal cases. The test set consists of 624 images total, approximately 10.68% of the total set of images.
